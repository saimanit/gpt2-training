In this project, I've developed a pipeline using Python to process text from a PDF, which is typically a resume, train a language model on this text, and then use the trained model to generate text. Let me walk you through the key parts of my notebook:

**Setup and Initializations**
- Dependencies: I started by installing the necessary Python libraries including `PyPDF2` for reading PDF files, `datasets` for managing our data, and `transformers` for leveraging pre-built models and utilities.
- **Imports**: I imported the essential libraries such as `torch` and components from `transformers` to set up our environment.

### **Extracting Data**
- **Reading the PDF**: I used `PyPDF2` to read text from a PDF file. This text extraction is critical as it forms the data basis for our model training.

### **Data Processing**
- **Tokenization**: I tokenized the extracted text using a tokenizer from the Hugging Face `transformers` library. This process converts the text into a format that's suitable for model input, ensuring that it can be effectively processed by our neural network.

### **Model Training and Evaluation**
- **Training Setup**: I defined a custom dataset class for our tokenized text, allowing it to be efficiently handled during training.
- **Model Training**: I trained a GPT-2 model on this dataset, using a Trainer class with specified training arguments. This setup included defining custom metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as loss and perplexity.
- **Results**: The training loss was approximately 3.92, and the evaluation loss was about 3.29 with a perplexity of 26.72. These numbers indicate the model's learning progress and its ability to generalize based on the text it trained on.

### **Generating New Text**
- **Setup**: I prepared a prompt reflecting typical professional experience to guide the text generation.
- **Execution**: Using the trained model, I generated new text that extends the input prompt, showcasing the model's capability to synthesize professional descriptions relevant to job applications or enhancing resumes.

### **Conclusion and Future Steps**
- The model shows promising results, but there is potential for improvement. I could enhance the model's performance by adjusting training parameters, extending the training dataset, or refining the post-processing of the generated text to ensure it meets professional standards.

This workflow demonstrates a practical application of NLP techniques to automate and enhance document-based tasks such as resume writing or job application preparation. If you have any questions about specific steps or the results, feel free to ask!
